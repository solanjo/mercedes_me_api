This repository contains a script in order to collect data from the sensors of a Mercedes-Benz car using [Mercedes me API](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products).

## Pre-Requirements
1) Own a Mercedes Benz Car with Mercedes me installed and working.
2) Create an application in https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/
3) Subscribe to the following APIs (all of them):
   - [Electric Vehicle Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/electric_vehicle_status)
   - [Fuel Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/fuel_status)
   - [Pay As You Drive Insurance](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/pay_as_you_drive_insurance) 
   - [Vehicle Lock Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/vehicle_lock_status)
   - [Vehicle Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/vehicle_status)

Notes: 
1) the APIs described above do not require any subscription in case you use them with your own car associated with the Mercedes me Account.
2) not all sensors may be available in your own car; if a sensor is not available the data request returns no data.
3) only one car is supported for the moment.

### Open Points & Issues
- Complete OAUTH2 Authentication & Get the First Token
- Get state after starts -> now it waits <scan_interval> seconds.
- Config Flow for automatic configuration
- Log Management
- Bugfix & Software optimizations

For further details please refer to [issues list][issues-url].

## Shell Scripts
There is a shell script as Bash Version.

## Installation
To use this script it's necessary to perform the following instructions:
1) clone the repository
2) create a config file (.mercedesme_config) with:
```bash
CLIENT_ID=<INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
VEHICLE_ID=<INSERT_YOUR_VEHICLE_ID>
```

where CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET referring to the application information that can be found in [Mercedes Developer Console](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/console) and VEHICLE_ID is the VIN of your car.

## First Token Creation
To create the first token it's necessary to perform the following steps:
1) Create the APP and register it to all APIs as describe in the Pre-Requirements paragraph
2) Logout in all browser from Mercedes Me (Developer site included)
3) Execute the shell or python script with -t parameter to obtain the first token
4) Open with a browser the link provided by the script: a login page will be shown
5) Using your Mercedes Me credential log in: a new web-page will ask to authorize the APP created in the step 1 to access to the personal information associated to the APIs registered
6) Enable all information and press Allow
7) An error page will appear: check the URI: it's something like https://localhost/?code=DQ8htZSw4WtJ27r7sTrVJwszGWxrCx9emy5FDUFa
8) Copy the part of the URI after code= (in this case DQ8htZSw4WtJ27r7sTrVJwszGWxrCx9emy5FDUFa) and paste into the running script

### Bash Usage
To execute the script read below:
```bash
Usage:    mercedes_me_api.sh <arguments>

    -r, --refresh         Procedure to refresh the Access Token (stored into .mercedesme_token)
    -f, --fuel            Retrieve the Fuel Status of your Vehicle
    -l, --lock            Retrieve the Lock Status of your Vehicle
